# AngelScript Sven Co-Op Server Plugins
My Playground and hosted Angelscript server plugins for Sven Co-Op.

Please read the license. I'm basically asking don't just take this and make it private with your changes. It's not helpful to the Sven community if you're just going to hide good plugins from the public. I hope someday there will be more AS plugins available for the general public, and I hope to be someone that will provide. Also, give credit where credit is due.

Also please, submit bugs or suggestions through the Issues or Pull Requests respectively.
